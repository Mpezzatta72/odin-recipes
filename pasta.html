         <ul>
         <ls> Shrimp Pasta
            This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta, fettuccine, or spaghetti.</ls>
            
          <ls>  Butter
            Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.</ls>
            
           <ls> Extra-virgin olive oil
            The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the best quality.</ls>
            
            <ls>Shallots and garlic
            These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.</ls>
            
            <ls>White wine
            Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover wine with dinner.</ls>
            
            <ls>Lemon juice
            Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.</ls>
            
            <ls>Seasonings
            Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a subtle kick. Use more red pepper flakes if you like things a bit more spicy.</ls>
            
            <ls>Parsley
            Fresh parsley adds eye-catching color and a bright, peppery flavor.</ls>
